# Recommended Tools for SAS Viya Administrators

The following tools and utilities have proven useful to the authors of this project, so we collected a list of them here for convenience.

| Tool | What is it useful for? |
|------| ---------------------- |
| The kubernetes CLI, [kubectl](https://kubernetes.io/docs/reference/kubectl/) | Excellent for inspecting the contents and status of nodes, namespaces, pods, logs and much more in a Kubernetes cluster, interactively and in scripts. |
| [Lens Desktop](https://k8slens.dev/desktop.html) | Desktop application for viewing and managing Kubernetes clusters. Built on top of OpenLens, but includes additional software and libraries with different licenses. Developed by Mirantis. Requires registration. |
| [Lens Desktop Core ("OpenLens")](https://github.com/lensapp/lens) | The core components of Lens Desktop, open source. No registration required. </br>See [this blog post](https://alexandre-vazquez.com/openlens-vs-lens/#:~:text=The%20main%20difference%20is%20that,distributed%20under%20a%20traditional%20EULA.) for an explanation of the difference between Lens Desktop and OpenLens. |
| [K9s](https://k9scli.io/) | A terminal based UI to interact with your Kubernetes clusters. |
| The [sas-viya CLI](../tasks/install_sas_viya_cli.md) | The SAS Viya Command-Line Interface includes many plug-in modules supporting a broad variety of SAS Viya administration activity. |
| [pyviyatools](https://github.com/sassoftware/pyviyatools) | A somewhat eclectic set of useful command-line tools that call the SAS Viya REST APIs from Python. Developed primarily to support the needs of classes we developed or requirements we found no other elegant way of meeting.</br>See [Introducing Python-based command-line tools for SAS Viya](https://blogs.sas.com/content/sgf/2018/12/18/python-based-command-line-tools/) for a short introduction.|
