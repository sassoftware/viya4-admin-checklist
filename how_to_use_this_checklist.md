# How to Use This Checklist

Many of the tasks in the [checklist](./checklist.md) take significant effort to complete. It is not likely that an administrator will simply check them off, unless he or she is reviewing the administration framework already in place for an established SAS deployment. For this reason (among others), do not leave administration and housekeeping tasks until the end of your implementation project as an afterthought. Consider every item on the [checklist](./checklist.md) at the beginning of an implementation project. Plan the project to include deliverables relating to each task that you choose to perform with appropriate timescales, dependencies, and resource and effort allocation to ensure they can be completed.

The ongoing, regular housekeeping tasks in the second list can be considered the role and responsibility of a SAS administrator or IT administrator.

If you are not sure what a SAS administrator does, the two checklists serve as a good starting point for a job description, to which duties more unique to your environment can be added. The initial tasks stray freely into the areas of enterprise and technical architecture, installation and deployment, and implementation and customization. Some tasks might not be the responsibility of a SAS administrator in your organization, but it is important for the administrator to know whether and how they have been done by the project implementation team. Some of these tasks have significant overlap with general IT administration and governance.
