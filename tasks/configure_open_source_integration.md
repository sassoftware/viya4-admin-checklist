The SAS Viya platform must be configured to allow integration of Python and R
into processing by CAS servers and the SAS programming run-time servers. Configuring
open source integration enables the SAS Viya platform to leverage open-source
languages from:

* Code running in compute, batch, or connect servers
* SAS Studio
* SAS Studio's Python editor
* SAS/IML code
* SAS Visual Data Mining and Machine Learning's Open Source Code node
* SAS Visual Forecasting's TSMODEL procedure and its timedata.RunTimecode action
* The FCMP procedure.
