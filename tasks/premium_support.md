## Consider whether you require premium or customized support for your SAS deployment

Consider whether the members of your SAS support team can perform all the administrative and support tasks that you want. Appropriate training might be necessary to allow them to provide this support.

If you are not already using them, consider enagaging services which can enhance your ability to support a SAS Viya platform, including [SAS Premium Support](https://www.sas.com/en_us/services/support-offerings/premium-support.html), [SAS Managed Application Services](https://www.sas.com/en_gb/solutions/cloud/sas-cloud/managed-application-services.html) and choosing a SAS Hosted Platform solution on [SAS Cloud Managed Services](https://www.sas.com/en_gb/solutions/cloud/sas-cloud.html).

Discuss your potential requirements for SAS Premium Support or SAS Application Management with your SAS account manager or with your SAS partner. Your discussion could include topics based on the checklists in this document. Discussions should include your specific business applications for your SAS software.
