If you chose [SAS Viya Monitoring for Kubernetes](https://github.com/sassoftware/viya4-monitoring-kubernetes) [GitHub], read how to satisfy the prerequisites and deploy the software following guidance under [Welcome to SAS Viya Monitoring for Kubernetes](https://go.documentation.sas.com/doc/en/obsrvcdc/default/obsrvdply/n0bzfdp3bn6p4vn1lj9pm2hy8t0q.htm) [Doc].

Or use the instructions provided for your chosen cloud hosting providerâ€™s own logging, monitoring and alerting capabilities to do the same.

> Note: For simplicity, some tasks in this checklist assume that you chose and are using SAS Viya Monitoring for Kubernetes for log and metric monitoring. The concepts are similar if you chose a different observability solution.

Use the monitoring and alerting capabilities of your chosen solution (as well as kubectl commands and operating system tools) to routinely and proactively check the health and availability of your Viya platform's components. For example:
* Perform tests that [services/pods are running](https://go.documentation.sas.com/doc/en/sasadmincdc/default/calchkadm/n00003ongoingtasks00000admin.htm) [Doc]
* Check readiness of services using [sas-readiness](https://go.documentation.sas.com/doc/en/sasadmincdc/default/dplyml0phy0dkr/n16qo9qr3qy3f6n1dabs8jhvsxo4.htm) [Doc]
* Verify that key user-facing services are responsive. For example, check that SAS Environment Manager, SAS Studio and SAS Visual Analytics URLs successfully respond to HTTP requests (i.e. from a cURL command).
* Monitor consumption of resources such as free and used disk space, memory and usage, and network and I/O usage in your cluster. Grafana is the monitoring solution delivered with SAS Viya Monitoring for Kubernetes, and it provides several [dashboards](https://go.documentation.sas.com/doc/en/obsrvcdc/default/obsrvdply/p0hdli5mj0rcr5n16tev89poxmlb.htm) [Doc]  out-of-the-box which can help administrators visually explore resource utilisation within the cluster. You can also supplement these with [additional custom dashboards](https://go.documentation.sas.com/doc/en/obsrvcdc/default/obsrvdply/n1sg9bc44ow616n1sw7l3dlsbmgz.htm) [Doc] .
* View [currently running jobs](https://go.documentation.sas.com/doc/en/obsrvcdc/default/obsrvdply/p0fv84e6amqsfun1uvfwnh0oevhw.htm)
* [View log messages](https://go.documentation.sas.com/doc/en/obsrvcdc/default/obsrvdply/n1u4s2nmjlijs8n1ki7757efhdmv.htm)  generated by Viya services/pods
* Define alerts that are triggered when resource usage exceeds a defined threshold. An alerting strategy should include triage depending on issue severity, escalation channels, sending of timely notifications to appropriate parties, troubleshooting procedures/runbooks, suppression of alerts and a process to review and adjust thresholds regularly. SAS Viya Monitoring for Kubernetes includes many alert notifications out-of-the-box (provided by Prometheus/Alertmanager) for things like high memory/disk/network usage, but you may wish to supplement to these with [additional custom alerts](https://go.documentation.sas.com/doc/en/obsrvcdc/default/obsrvdply/p0c3njkuzu5ssqn1xu6k1oe1nwp3.htm#n00izscmsryfswn1rxnezyl0odih) to suit business requirements (for example, an alert for high CAS server memory consumption). Metrics on which alerts are based can be explored using the [Prometheus expression browser](https://prometheus.io/docs/visualization/browser/).
