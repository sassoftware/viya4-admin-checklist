Define and document your organization’s SAS support team structure, roles, and responsibilities.

If appropriate, document when team members are scheduled to be on duty, and how
an 'on call' service is to be provided.

Identify the training needs of each team member, including SAS training.

Your support team might include named SAS, Kubernetes and IT administrators, storage
and database administrators, product or technical specialists, and other support
staff who assist users and keep services running.
