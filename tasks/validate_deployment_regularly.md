# Regularly Re-Validate your SAS Viya Deployment

<!--
SortString: 0600
Description: Run a set of tests to validate that your SAS Viya deployment is functioning correctly
Tags: Regular,New,Done
Topic: SAS Administration
Essential: -
Authors: David Stern
Frequency: Weekly
-->
When: Regularly, e.g. weekly

Periodically run tests that validate whether more end-user facing behaviour is
functioning correctly. The task [Validate your SAS Viya Deployment](./validate_deployment.md)
describes how to define such validation steps.

This is valuable in addition to defining alerts in your monitoring tools to
detect more technical outages, such as services being down, compute resources
being too heavily consumed etc., and may reveal the impact of a technical outage
on end user experience which is helps you more clearly communicate with your
users the effect of a technical outage for them.
