Design and maintain a schedule of housekeeping administration activities for
your SAS Viya platform, specifying when regular tasks should be performed.

The [Regular Task section of the Checklist](../checklist.md#regular-task-checklist)
has a frequency column, **but this is just a suggestion**.

You should absolutely use your own judgement about how often it makes sense
to perform each ongoing task for your SAS Viya platform deployment. Every
organization has different needs, and the most appropriate frequency for regular
tasks depends greatly on whether they are manual or automated for your deployment
, how much effort/resource it takes to perform the task, and the relative
business value of doing it more or less often. We don't know those values for
your deployment, and you are more likely to.
