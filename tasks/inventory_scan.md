An inventory scan is used to document the current configuration and content in a
Viya environment. A scan provides the data for two Visual Analytics reports:

* SAS Viya Inventory Report surfaces the result of a single scan
* SAS Viya Inventory Comparison compares the results of two separate scans

A Viya administrator should perform a scan before any major changes in the
environment and a scan and comparison after any major changes.
