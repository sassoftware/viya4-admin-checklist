SAS Viya includes a set of command-line interfaces that allows Viya
administrators to perform numerous administrative tasks in batch as an
alternative to using the SAS Environment Manager interface.

1. Download the sas-viya CLI from support.sas.com
2. Install the sas-viya executable
3. Install all sas-viya CLI plugins
4. Plan to update the CLI and all of its plugins on a regular basis
