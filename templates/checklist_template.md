# SAS Viya Administration Checklist

> Please read the **[Project README](./README.md)** if you have not done so already.

This checklist lists both [initial](#initial-task-checklist) tasks, and [regular](#regular-task-checklist) tasks. The regular tasks are then also presented in a task schedule, indicating at a glance a suggested frequency at which each regular task might be performed.

Alternatively, view the same [tasks grouped by topic](./tasks_by_topic.md).

@_#_ Lines starting @_#_ are comment lines in the template
## Initial Task Checklist

This table lists larger tasks. You should consider performing them once. You
should revisit these tasks if major elements of SAS Viya change or your business
requirements change. Tasks in this checklist do not need to be repeated on a
regular scheduled basis.

@_#_ @ followed by _TOC_ is a special string which inserts a table of contents
@_#_ when parsed.

@_#_ A table of contents can have multiple parameters separated by commas - all
@_#_ parameters are optional.

@_#_ A table of contents can have multiple values for strTagFilter separated by
@_#_ semicolons (';'), e.g. strTagFilter=Initial;Done. The logic for filtering
@_#_ by multiple values for strTagFilter is AND, i.e. for
@_#_ strTagFilter=Initial;Done, a task is only listed if it is tagged with both
@_#_ Initial AND Done. There is currently no way to express an OR (e.g. to show
@_#_ Backlog and InProgress together in a single table, whereby a task is
@_#_ listed if it is tagged with Backlog OR InProgress).

@_TOC_ strTagFilter=Initial;Done,intSortColumn=0,boolReverse=False,boolShowTags=False,boolShowFreq=False,boolShowTopic=True,boolShowEssential=True

## Regular Task Checklist

This table lists smaller tasks that should be repeated on a regular basis. See the [Regular Task Schedule](#regular-task-schedule) which follows this table for an example of when you might run each of these tasks.

@_TOC_ strTagFilter=Regular;Done,intSortColumn=0,boolReverse=False,boolShowTags=False,boolShowFreq=True,boolShowTopic=True,boolShowEssential=True

## Regular Task Schedule

This table shows the same regular tasks as the [Regular Task Checklist](#regular-task-checklist) table above, but is focussed more on how often we suggest each regular task might be run.

@_RTFREQ_ strTagFilter=Regular;Done,intSortColumn=0,boolReverse=False

@_#_ IMPORTANT: This template should end with a newline
