## Backlog

These tasks are in the backlog to be written, and are stubs, ideas, or part-complete but not under active development. These tasks do not appear in the main [checklist](./checklist.md) or in the lists of [tasks grouped by topic](./tasks_by_topic.md).

@_#_ @ followed by _TOC_ is a special string which inserts a table of contents when parsed
@_TOC_ strTagFilter=Backlog,intSortColumn=0,boolShowTags=False,boolShowFreq=False

## In Progress

These tasks are currently being worked on. These tasks do not appear in the main [checklist](./checklist.md) or in the lists of [tasks grouped by topic](./tasks_by_topic.md).

@_TOC_ strTagFilter=InProgress,intSortColumn=0,boolShowTags=False,boolShowFreq=False

## Review

These tasks are written and ready for review, pending publication as 'Done'. These tasks do not appear in the main [checklist](./checklist.md) or in the lists of [tasks grouped by topic](./tasks_by_topic.md).

@_TOC_ strTagFilter=Review,intSortColumn=0,boolShowTags=False,boolShowFreq=False

## Done

These tasks are done, finished, complete and ready for public consumption.

> **Important**: Only tasks tagged with `Done` are shown in the main [checklist](./checklist.md) or in the lists of [tasks grouped by topic](./tasks_by_topic.md). Tasks tagged as `Backlog`, `InProgress` and `Review` are not included in the checklists on those pages.

## New

These tasks are new in this Checklist for SAS Viya 2020.1 and later. They have no equivalent in either of our earlier checklists.

@_TOC_ strTagFilter=New,intSortColumn=0,boolShowTags=True,boolShowFreq=False

## Legacy

These tasks are the modern SAS Viya 2020.1 equivalent of an task which also appeared in one of our earlier checklists. This task may differ significantly from its earlier equivalent.

@_TOC_ strTagFilter=Legacy,intSortColumn=0,boolShowTags=True,boolShowFreq=False

@_#_ IMPORTANT: This template should end with a newline
